# onebot-open-source
ONEBot, but open source :grin:

Prerequisites:
nodejs
discordjs
I probably missed something - if you get an error, just run npm install `whatever`

# Installation
###### oh the joys

$ git clone https://github.com/1TV-IE/onebot-open-source.git

then run $ node index.js

yay it should work

if it doesn't (internal screaming occurs), send me an email or DM me on le discord
